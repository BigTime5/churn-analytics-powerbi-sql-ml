# Objective

- **What is the key pain point?**

The Head of Customer Retention and the Marketing Team lack a centralized solution to understand why telecom customers are churning, identify at-risk segments, and predict future churners. Manual analysis and fragmented data sources hinder effective retention strategies.

- **What is the ideal solution?**

To create an end-to-end solution that:
- Implements an ETL pipeline to process customer data.
- Analyzes churn patterns across demographics, geography, account info, and services.
- Predicts future churners using a Random Forest machine learning model.
- Visualizes insights in a Power BI dashboard, showing:
  - Total Customers, Total Churn, Churn Rate, New Joiners.
  - Churn by contract type, payment method, service type, and region.

This will empower the team to design targeted retention campaigns and reduce churn effectively.

## User Story

As the Head of Customer Retention, I want to use a Power BI dashboard that analyzes telecom customer data and predicts churn using machine learning, so that I can identify at-risk segments, understand churn drivers, and implement proactive retention strategies to maximize ROI.

# Data Source

- **What data is needed to achieve our objective?**

We need telecom customer data including:
- Customer ID, Gender, Age, Region (State), Tenure.
- Contract Type, Monthly Charges, Payment Method.
- Services subscribed (Phone, Internet, Streaming, etc.).
- Customer Status (Churned, Stayed, Joined).

- **Where is the data coming from?**

The data is sourced from an internal staging table (`stg_Churn`) in the companyâ€™s SQL Server database (`db_Churn`). This table contains historical customer data used for analysis and prediction.

# Stages

- Analysis

# Design

## Dashboard Components Required

To meet the requirements, the dashboard must answer:
1. What are the Total Customers, Total Churn, Churn Rate, and New Joiners?
2. How does churn vary by Gender, State, Contract Type, and Services?
3. Which customers are predicted to churn, and what are their profiles?
4. What are the key risk factors for churn (e.g., tenure, contract types)?

Appropriate visuals include:
- Scorecards (for metrics like Total Customers, Churn Rate).
- Bar charts (for churn by Gender, State, Contract).
- Tables (for predicted churners).
- Filters (for interactive segmentation).

## Tools

| Tool           | Purpose                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| SQL Server     | ETL pipeline, data cleaning, and views   |
| Python         | Random Forest model for churn prediction |
| Power BI       | Visualizing data via interactive dashboards |

# Development

## Pseudocode

1. Extract raw data from the `stg_Churn` table in SQL Server.
2. Explore the data to identify patterns and issues (e.g., nulls, distributions).
3. Clean and transform the data (handle nulls, standardize formats).
4. Load the cleaned data into a production table (`prod_Churn`).
5. Create SQL views for Power BI (`vw_ChurnData`, `vw_JoinData`).
6. Develop a Random Forest model to predict churn.
7. Visualize insights in Power BI.
8. Document the process and publish to GitHub.

## Data Exploration Notes

- **Initial Observations**:
  1. The dataset contains all required fields (Customer ID, Gender, State, Contract, Services, etc.).
  2. Some columns (e.g., Internet Type, Value Deal) have null values that need handling.
  3. Customer Status includes "Churned," "Stayed," and "Joined," aligning with metrics needs.
  4. Tenure and Monthly Charges show variability, which may correlate with churn.

### SQL Query - Check Distinct Values

#### Gender Distribution
```sql
SELECT Gender, Count(Gender) as TotalCount,
Count(Gender) * 1.0 / (Select Count(*) from stg_Churn) as Percentage
FROM stg_Churn
GROUP BY Gender
```
#### Output 
![Gender Distribution](assets/images/Gender.jpg)

#### Contract Distribution
```sql
SELECT Contract, Count(Contract) as TotalCount,
Count(Contract) * 1.0 / (Select Count(*) from stg_Churn) as Percentage
FROM stg_Churn
GROUP BY Contract
```
#### Output
![Contract Distribution](assets/images/contract.jpg)

#### Customer Status
```sql
SELECT Customer_Status, Count(Customer_Status) as TotalCount, Sum(Total_Revenue) as TotalRev,
Sum(Total_Revenue) / (Select sum(Total_Revenue) from stg_Churn) * 100 as RevPercentage
FROM stg_Churn
GROUP BY Customer_Status
```
#### Output
![Customer Status](assets/images/customer_status.jpg)

#### State Distribution
```sql
SELECT State, Count(State) as TotalCount,
Count(State) * 1.0 / (Select Count(*) from stg_Churn) as Percentage
FROM stg_Churn
GROUP BY State
ORDER BY Percentage DESC
```
#### Output
![State Distribution](assets/images/State.jpg)

## Data Cleaning

### Expected Clean Data Standards
- No null values in critical columns (handled using ISNULL)
- Consistent data types (e.g., integers for numerical fields)
- Only relevant records (invalid Customer IDs removed)

  
| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Number of Rows | 6418 |
| Number of Columns | 31 |

#### -Steps
- Check for null values in all columns.
- Replace nulls with default values (e.g., "None" for categorical, "No" for binary).
- Insert cleaned data into the prod_Churn table.

## Validation

### 1. Churn by Contract Type

#### Calculation Breakdown

**Campaign Idea**: Offer discounts to month-to-month contract customers.

| Metric                 | Details                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Churn Rate**         | 46.5% (Summary Dashboard)        |
| **Affected Customers** | ~806 (46.5% of 1732 total churners) |
| **Avg. Monthly Charge**| $62.80 (average from Prediction Dashboard) |
| **Potential Revenue Loss** | 806 x $62.80 = $50,617/month   |
| **Campaign Cost**      | 10% discount for 3 months: $62.80 x 10% x 3 x 806 = $15,174 |
| **Net Savings**        | $50,617 - $15,174 = $35,443/month |

**Best Option**: Target month-to-month contract customers for retention campaigns.

#### Output

### 2. Churn by State

#### Calculation Breakdown

**Campaign Idea**: Region-specific promotions in Jammu & Kashmir.

| Metric                 | Details                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Churn Rate**         | 57.2% (Summary Dashboard)        |
| **Affected Customers** | ~44 (based on Prediction Dashboard) |
| **Avg. Monthly Charge**| $62.80                           |
| **Potential Revenue Loss** | 44 x $62.80 = $2,763/month     |
| **Campaign Cost**      | Targeted ads: $500               |
| **Net Savings**        | $2,763 - $500 = $2,263/month     |

**Best Option**: Focus on Jammu & Kashmir, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu for localized retention efforts.

#### Output

## Discovery

- **What Did We Learn?**
  1. Month-to-month contracts are a major churn driver (46.5% churn rate), likely due to flexibility in switching providers.
  2. High churn in Jammu & Kashmir (57.2%) may indicate regional competition or service issues.
  3. Customers without Online Security (84.6%) and with Paperless Billing (74.6%) are at higher risk.
  4. The Random Forest model predicts 378 customers at risk, with key factors being month-to-month contracts, short tenure (6-12 months), and specific states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.

# Recommendations

- **What Do We Recommend?**
  1. **Target Month-to-Month Customers**: Offer incentives (e.g., 10% discount, free add-ons) to encourage longer contracts.
  2. **Focus on High-Churn Regions**: Run localized campaigns in Jammu & Kashmir, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu to address regional churn drivers.
  3. **Promote Protective Services**: Encourage adoption of Online Security to reduce churn risk (84.6% churn without it).
  4. **Reassess Paperless Billing**: Investigate why 74.6% of paperless billing users churn; consider offering opt-out incentives.
  5. **Proactive Retention for Predicted Churners**: Use the Random Forest modelâ€™s predictions to prioritize outreach to the 378 high-risk customers.

### Potential ROI

- **Month-to-Month Campaign**: Net savings of $35,443/month by reducing churn among 806 customers.
- **Regional Campaigns**: Net savings of $2,263/month in Jammu & Kashmir; potential for $6,000/month if expanded to Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.
- **Predicted Churners**: Retaining 50% of the 378 predicted churners could save 189 x $62.80 = $11,869/month.

### Potential Courses of Actions

- **Action Plan**:
  1. Launch a discount campaign for month-to-month contract customers within the next 30 days.
  2. Initiate targeted ads in Jammu & Kashmir, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, focusing on service reliability.
  3. Promote Online Security and offer paperless billing opt-out incentives.
  4. Use the Random Forest modelâ€™s predictions to send personalized offers to high-risk customers (e.g., free Online Security for 3 months).
  5. Monitor campaign performance and adjust strategies monthly.

- **Steps to Implement**:
  1. Collaborate with the Marketing Team to design campaigns.
  2. Automate the Random Forest pipeline to refresh predictions weekly.
  3. Set up Power BI data refresh (daily/weekly) to track metrics in real-time.
  4. Review churn reduction after 3 months and optimize campaigns.
